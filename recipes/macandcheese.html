        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Macaroni and cheese (also known as mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom[2]) is a pasta dish of macaroni covered in cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar sauce.Its origins trace back to cheese and pasta casseroles in medieval England.The traditional macaroni and cheese is put in a casserole dish and baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove, sometimes using a packaged mix such as became popular in the mid-20th century. </p>
